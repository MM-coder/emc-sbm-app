# Student - Board Meetings APP
## Made for EMC by Mauro M.

### What is SBM?
SBM stands for **S**tudent **B**oard **M**eetings witch are monthly meetings that occur between representatives of each class and a panel (board) of faculty members including the school's [deputy head teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_head_teacher).

### Why?
~~Boredom~~ I made this to help all the members of these SBMs organize the meetings better. From here you will be able to confirm your presence, vote on topics and create proposals for others to vote on.
